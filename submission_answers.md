Q1, It is important to use code libraries as it can save time and can also improve the quality of the program.
Having code librarys will help you when creating a large program as you can use the same library over and over again for different projects if they meet the needs which can reduce project development time and improve the relibality of the software.
Using code libraries in a group project can also be helpful for example if one the team members need a specic code but there is already a library written which does the function they can just use the library instead wrtitiing the whole code again.


Q2, The purpose of #include is to tell the C preprocessor to include all the contents of the file that are specified in the input stream to the compiler and then continue with the rest of the original file.
When it comes to .h files its primary roles is to propagate declarations to code files. This allows programmers to import whenever they need them.
